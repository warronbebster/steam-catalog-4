                <br/>
                <p>This Catalogue, like the catalogue of a show, is a collection of documented work. At STEAM, this includes workshops, lectures, discussions, and writing we created this fall.</p>
                <p>STEAM Press, the mechanism through which Catalogue is published, accepts submissions from members of our communities, and outside contributors. Please reach out to us if you would like to add to the next issue of Catalogue.</p>
                <!--<p>The theme of this Catalogue is “Call and Response”. The catalogue's format centers around this concept - the digital version takes visual cues from print tradition, and vice versa.</p>-->

                <p>The Great Wildebeest Migration is an annual trek from the southern Serengeti to southwestern Kenya. Hundreds of thousands of wildebeests, zebras, gazelles, and other plains game move in herds across Tanzania, in search of food. During their migration, the herds must cross the crocodile-ridden Mara and Grumeti Rivers.</p>
                <p>The wildebeest move in a swarm. When one sees a crocodile, it calls to the others, and they all react accordingly. Their fast, erratic movement and constant vigilance disorient their predators.</p>
                <p class="fourtwenty">The zebras stand back and, with careful planning, find the safest route across the river. They move in small families, and are careful to not attract attention. </p>

                <p>However, their predictable movement makes the zebra easy prey for the crocodile. The swarm mentality [to try every possible option, to constantly call and respond to your compatriots, to experiment until you have the most efficient and successful method] keeps the wildebeest alive.</p>
                <p>Each semester, the STEAM Clubs collect documentation of all our creations from the season, in response to calls for successful interdisciplinary work. Catalogue is our broadcast. Like the wildebeest work together to cross the river, the STEAM movement progresses through communal learning. We treat Catalogue as a call to the STEAM community, to educators, politicians, administrators, industry leaders, rocket scientists, brain surgeons, manufacturers, healthcare workers, mathematicians, artists, and designers.</p>
                <p>Our call [this is where we are, this is the path that we took, this is how you can replicate our experience] is delineated in the following pages, and it awaits your response.</p>

                <p class="bold"> The Concept</p>
                <p> The concept for the STEAM Pavilion began as a “what if” dream: What if STEAM had its own building– a space specifically for STEAM events? What would that look like? </p>
                <p>The idea came about after a semester of organizing STEAM events that were scattered across campus, in List Art Center, the Biomedical Center, Barus & Holley / the Brown Design Workshop, the Science Center, the Rock, as well as at RISD. We also received some feedback that STEAM seemed too exclusive, and that our emphasis on student interest-driven projects– <span class="show_mobile"> i.e. that we’re interested in every intersection of science and art that you’re interested in, from storytelling, dance, and neuroscience to math and education, not just biology/engineering and design– was lost on most of the student body. Brown STEAM is growing, thanks to many successful events and passionate students, but it is still not as accessible and visible as we’d like it to be.</span>

                <p> That’s where the idea for a unifying, interdepartmental space came in. Conceptually, this space, called the STEAM Pavilion, will be an iconic, physical representation of our goals for STEAM’s presence on College Hill in Providence: accessible, versatile, and inspiring. We came up with these conceptual design goals after about three meetings with our collaborators, the designers from Pneuhaus, a local design company founded by RISD furniture graduates.</p>

                <p>Although I officially spearheaded this project, this endeavor was unique in that all members of the Brown STEAM student leadership team were involved. In other words, on top of other bioSTEAM, C+STEAM, educational outreach, and guest speaker events, we all got together to discuss our ideas for the Pavilion. The team consisted of myself (Engineering/Visual Art, Senior), Jonelle Ahiligwo (Biology/Public Health, Junior), Noah Schlottman (Environmental Students/Music, Junior), John Filmanowicz (Computer Science, Sophomore), Kenji Endo (Computer Science, Visual Art, Freshman), Chelsea Phan (Mechanical Engineering, Sophomore), Rana Ozdeslik (Molecular Pharmacology, Physiology, and Biotechnology, 4th year Graduate Student).

                <p>Prior to meeting Pneuhaus in September at the Better World by Design Conference, I had been considering constructing the Pavilion from lightweight plywood and metal hardware because I wanted the Pavilion to be easily assembled, disassembled and stored. As soon as I stepped in Pneuhaus’ RGBubble, a spacious pneumatic “bubble” lounge, at the Better World Conference, I rethought the materials selection for the Pavilion.

                <p> Critically, our meetings were fueled by an excess of baked goods, tea, and craft paper turned tablecloth for sketching. We identified the most important aspects of the Pavilion to be: </p>
                <p>
                (1)  Portability: easy to put up, take down, and store; lightweight <br/>
                (2)  Accessibility: intuitive to interact with <br/>
                (3)  Versatility: able to host different types of events, such as presentations, workshops, and exhibits <br/>
                (4)  Capacity: able to hold at least 40 people <br/>

                <!--<p class="bold"> A reflection on new leadership, Brown’s 250th, and the STEAM Pavilion:</p>-->
                <p>Rafaël Rozendaal visited RISD on Friday, April 3, 2015 to give a lecture. Rafaël's work has been circulating heavily recently; a focus on internet art and related aesthetics has been on the rise over the past few years with the rise of access and sharability. Rafaël's work has been dealing with the "internet" as a platform, however, for over a decade, starting in 2001. It's hard for us now to imagine a world where fine art and the internet are disentangled; with new platforms, curation efforts, buy-in from credible institutions, and even active archiving measures all part of the fabric of internet art at this point. Rafaël's work has been an integral part of this tide; the rhetoric of "why don't I make the website the art?" seems obvious now, but someone had to ask it first.</p>

                <p>It seemed prudent to invite Rafaël at a time when more students than ever are considering or actively engaging the internet in their practice, whether literally or thematically, to hear the reasoning behind his practice. The relevance of his work to the student body was well represented by the turnout: the Chace auditorium was filled to capacity, with some resorting to standing. This also reflected the interest of multiple disciplines in his work; though many can see the direct relevance to graphic design or painting, his work also brought students from textiles, (directly related, as it turned out, as he's working on some fabric prints) industrial design, illustration, digital + media, architecture and other majors.</p>

                <p>His rhetoric behind using the browser as a medium was quite refreshingly egalitarian. Purportedly, once access to the internet supersedes access to urban cultural centers, art that lives on the internet allows appreciation and access to a much wider pool of people than art in urban centers. This is beneficial to the artist and the viewers; more exposure on one hand, and more access to art on the other. He also spoke about his process of selling work that doesn't exist physically and the development of his internet works contract. His sales involve the sale of the domain, one of the only things on the internet that isn't only artificially scarce, and for the purchaser to keep the work in the public domain so that access is kept open. This is something endemic to websites; most art sales, as he mentioned, have the chance at ending up in a collector's basement somewhere.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right chunk">
                <p>After he moved on to talks about the other half of his practice (read: shows, lenticulars, and poetry) we opened up for questions, many of which were about the nature of his sales and what happens to the work when the technical standards change and the websites are no longer visitable. The quotable answer was that even if the websites fail after 10 years, that's still the longest solo show in the history of art. All in all, the talk hopefully got many more people thinking about the medium specificity of the web and how to incorporate it into their practices.

                <p> In 2014, the World Health Organization radically revised their definition of disability. The crux of this change was to define disability as context dependent rather than as an attribute of a person. Interactions with technology are a clear example of this shift. Most of us experience disabilities that are temporary or situational on a daily basis. A person’s physical abilities change dramatically as they move through multiple environments. In a loud crowd, they can’t hear well. In a car, they’re visually and cognitively impaired. A new parent spends much of their day doing tasks one-handed. Interactions with technology depend heavily on what a person sees, hears, says, smells, and touches.</p>

Margaret is a design strategist who lives in the intersection between research, business strategy, design, and technology. In a world where many are focused on looking forward, she believes looking back can provide a deep level of insight into the human condition and a unique perspective on creative problem solving. Kat works on building connections between design, cultural insights, and human behavior. She believes technology has a lot to learn from people and that human interaction can be a powerful metaphor for digital interaction design. She brings these insights to life through creative strategy and product execution.</p>

                <p> After initial introductions, Margaret set the tone for the first day of Inclusive Design with some opening thoughts on her team’s research into Inclusive Design. Stemming from the World Health Organization’s newly refined definition of “disability” that focuses on situational disability, the team from Microsoft encouraged the workshop participants to look to human behavior to make technological experiences that are both universal and more personal in nature.</p>

                <p> After these opening remarks, volunteers of the Providence Deaf community joined the participants for user research interviews and lunch provided by the local Providence Flatbread Pizza Company. Betsy Beach (Providence community member), Mackenzie Woodburn (Brown Cognitive Neuroscience ’17), Alexander Laferriere (Brown Graduate student, focusing on filmmaking) <span class="show_mobile"> provided the participants with invaluable insights about the benefits and challenges of a more visually-centric culture that stems from the use of American Sign Language. By gaining a deeper understanding of a form of communication that relies heavily on visual and tactile cues, workshop participants were able to think about designing technological experiences in a new way that could benefit not only the Deaf community, but hearing users as well. These first-hand stories and perspectives on alternative forms of communication, as well as the drawbacks of existing technology experiences, inspired participants to rethink how technology currently connects or disconnects humans. </span></p>

                <p> Once user interviews concluded, the workshop participants continued to build empathy through exercises that allowed them to experience temporary blindness, deafness, or arthritis. Using <span class = "show_mobile"> altered goggles, headphones, and arm braces provided by Margaret and Kat, workshop participants were challenged to complete a basic task in their small groups while each member experienced one of these different disabilities.

                <p> After a night off from Inclusive Design, workshop participants came in the next morning refreshed with clearer concepts and ideas. For the first two hours, the groups refined the ideas that emerged in discussion at the end of the first day and crafted presentations to pitch at the end of the short day. Due to the short 1.5 day time frame of the workshop, final presentations focused more on illustration of concept and analysis, rather than a functioning prototype.

                <p> Once the presentations were finalized mid-morning on Day 2, the groups then pitched their ideas to not only Margaret and Kat, but also the user interview volunteers from the previous day. Microsoft’s film team from Cinelan, who are helping Margaret and Kat make an Inclusive Design documentary, also joined the group to view the presentations. Miao Wang, Damon Smith, Robert Chang of Cinelan sat in on both days of the workshop to get a deeper understanding of the Inclusive Design project within Microsoft Design.

The final projects showed a range of diverse and universal solutions that can benefit all of us. Our goal was to help students think differently and intrinsically embed Inclusive practices into the design process. We were impressed by the caliber of thinking of those who participated.

                <p>Upon arriving on a scattered campus this past fall as a freshman, I began to wonder what kind of projects I would come in contact with-- what kind of creative minds and inspiring people I would befriend. It wasn’t until the club fair that I came in contact with the RISD/Brown STEAM Team. The very idea of a student-run club integrating art and design with STEM science not only blew my mind but also brought me to an entirely new level of inspiration. Now, instead of making paintings on canvas, why not make paintings on microscope slides with bacteria? What if you took 3d scans of animals and combined them? What if I want to learn about the Internet as an art form? </p>

After showing interest at a workshop and lecture I was quickly adopted by the clubs welcoming members and incredible leaders, with whom I plan to work and create with in the coming years.

                <p> Studio Applied Math was an effort to start chipping away at the traditional model of STEM education, to re-engage new scientists at the onset of their careers, and to synthesize the sensitivity of the arts and design fields into a STEM context. </p>

                <p>“Studio Applied Math: Topics in Emergent Behavior” was a Group Independent Study Project (GISP) at Brown University, hosted by Björn Sandstede of the Division of Applied Mathematics in Spring semester 2015. What we sought is to take the structure of a studio art class (its key components being open-ended projects, continuous collaboration and peer-to-peer learning, regular critiques and feedback, and the professor as mentor <span class="show_mobile"> rather than delivering content), and create a math class in this format. </span>

                <p>We broke the semester into two halves. In the first, students designed and delivered interactive lectures on a breadth of topics under emergent behavior. Our midterm project was to formalize these lessons into stand-alone pedagogy tools, which took a variety of forms—two websites, an R package, a MATLAB GUI, and an IPython Notebook. </p>

                <p> After this, students decided on final projects and set off on 6 weeks of self-directed work. Our four projects were on automated cellular automata classification via machine learning, an expansion of simulating the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model, exploring bifurcations in a bacterial growth PDE system with fluid advection, and graph-theoretic properties of polynomials on finite fields. During each studio week we gave updates on our progress, and invited guest critics to lend each project new <span class="show_mobile"> eyes and insights from directions between the quantitative sciences of Math, Applied Math, Computer Science, Physics, and Engineering. </span></p>

                <p> At its core, this was an experiment in true form, an idea we ran with that could have crashed and burned. But it didn’t. The class, with 6 people total, each with strong research backgrounds from different departments, produced four original and deep research projects all under the umbrella of emergent behavior. Some things did not go as planned: we found a week-to-week schedule difficult for the pace of research possible, that focusing on the guests was sometimes misplaced as the projects were far outside their knowledge, and that the scope of “Emergent Behavior” was too large to ensure our projects would enmesh or learn from each other effectively. </p> 

                <p> Supported by both our successes and failures, we feel we have stuck a foot in the door for effective <span class = "show_mobile"> rethinking of what a STEM class can embody—openness, flexibility, and empowerment.

                <p>The mini_me workshop was the first event for C+STEAM, a new STEAM branch focused on computer science and technology. We formed the subgroup out of shared interest in the ways one can create art and design in the digital realm, apply programming design principles to other areas, or use hardware and software to visualize and create new experiences. This event’s planning was team effort with C+STEAM leaders from Brown and RISD – Kenji Endo (Brown ’18), John Filmanowicz (Brown ’17), Brian Oakes (RISD ’18), Miranda Chao (Brown ’18), Madison Beckerman (RISD ’18), and Rohan Rastogi (Brown ’18).

                <p>Throughout the Fall of 2014, project leader Ingrid Lange (RISD '16') brought together students from Brown and RISD with interest in teaching these interdisciplinary workshops to young students. Two workshops were implemented this semester with two more in development for the upcoming Spring: Avian Architecture, taught by Anthony Peer (RISD ’16) and Soo Hyun Shin (RISD MA ’15). This lesson integrated into the 3rd and 4th grade unit on Animal Ecosystems and provided a hands-on experience with the process birds use to build nests.</p>
                <p>Counting with Textiles, taught by Blake Mandell (Brown ’17) and Carl Romines (Brown ’16). Using basic loom weaving, this lesson for the kindergarteners blurred the line between the additive processes in math and textiles.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right chunk">
                <p> Our curricula were developed with teachers Jessica McGuire, Melissa Kranowitz, Sari Guttin, and Jamie Faith Woods to compliment the students’ general studies. Each lesson applied methodologies and principles unique to art and design thinking, such as hands-on experimentation with material exploration, iterative problem solving, and storytelling. STEAM is grateful for the generosity, effort, and enthusiasm of JCDS throughout this collaboration, as we develop an example for other K-5 educators interested in implementing STEAM curriculum into their schools.

                <p>Avian Architecture is essentially a look into the construction of a bird’s nest. In looking at the materials, process, and use of the nest as a component in design we can better understand how the birds adapt their nests to their environment as well as humanity’s interaction with nature.</p>
                <p class="bold">Goals of the Workshop</p>
                <p class="fourten">1. Collection: The first goal was to be able to get out into nature to be able to understand the material selection process that various bird species go through in the construction of their respective nests.

                <p class="threeeightfive">2. Examples: To fully understand what a nest is and the construction of a nest the children had to have physical examples of a bird’s nest. Real nests collected in nature from the RISD Nature Lab were brought in as examples for the building part of the workshop.</p>
                <p>3. Making: The making part of the workshop should be an open ended experience that allows the children to create based on the examples shown as well as allow them to utilize the information they have gathered to make their own conclusions as to the construction of a birds nest.</p>

                <p class="bold">Gathering Materials at Blackstone Park</p>
                <p>A very important aspect of the lesson was to allow the students to get outside and experience what it is like to collect nesting materials. On the first day of the workshop we took the students to Blackstone Park in Providence to collect some nesting materials and use their field guide notebooks as guidelines for collection. To emphasize the difference between reading about the materials used and actually knowing what the proper size, flexibility, and type of twig necessary to make the structure of a nest we looked at good and bad examples I collected. Being able to pick up a twig and recognize whether it has the proper qualities for the making of a nest was vital to understanding the selection process that a bird uses.</p>
                <p>The students in the class were able to have a learning experience, which was centered on creating something for the purpose of learning more about a topic in science rather then making for an arts and crafts based lesson.</p>

            <div class="right chunk">
                <p>A biologist or an archaeologist wouldn’t be able to learn about a topic from sitting in the library their whole career; so in many cases they go out into the field to gain a more personal experience. Being able to learn in the field rather then a classroom was vital to showing the students the complexity in the development of a nest, as well as view the effects that our waste has on the environment through material collection. Creating a nest using their own found materials enabled the children to have a more personal connection to the lesson, and ultimately a more enjoyable experience.</p>
                <p class="bold">Making Their Bird’s Nest</p>
                <p>Before we began the making portion of the workshop we went over some of the materials we gathered, and using real birds nests borrowed from the RISD Nature Lab observed the individual construction process of multiple bird species. One thing that I had anticipated (and should be considered in replicating this workshop) is the </p>

                <p>amount of time that the students had to make the nests. Making a nest is a very big time investment. Wire frame structures were provided to give the students a head start. Interestingly enough the children that decided to not use the wireframe structures provided for them made very convincing looking nests using the techniques shown in cup and woven nests. Students that had a little bit more difficulty in the development of their nests that choose to utilize the wireframe were then able to quickly put together a nest in the same amount of time as those who did not use a wireframe. Being able to cater the learning experience to all of the students involved allowed for a pleasant and constructive time of making. The final results of the making portion of the workshop had students with varying nest constructions. Some of the nests had their own little bird eggs in them as well as others that were hybrid nests constructed for an exotic bird crossover species. </p>

                <p>During this making portion of the workshop being able to direct the students in a way that allows them to both create something of their own as well as understand the steps in the construction of a bird’s nest is quite difficult, and could be improved upon if more time was available. Ultimately each student had an interesting approach to the making of their individual nests, and although not perfect representations of how a bird makes its nest they were very intuitive responses to what they learned about nest construction.</p>
                <p class="bold">What the Students Learned</p>
                <p>The students were able to evaluate their own nests in relation to the actual nests. Having time for reflecting on the lesson and observing their work allowed the students to see how difficult it was to replicate a nest, as well as have a more in depth look into the different materials they used. </p>

                <p class="fourfive">The students were asked to do a simple sketch of their nest as well as answer some questions as to the setting in which their nest could be found, and to describe the type of bird that lives in it. Being able to sketch the nest and observe it from a different viewpoint allowed them to see the materials used differently. Many of the students had pieces of trash and plastic in their nest, which they hadn’t noticed prior to the completion of the nest. Enabling the students to take a step back from what they had made and sketch their work allows for a broader understanding of the lesson as a whole.</p>
                <p>In asking the students what was the most difficult part many responded that their nest did not hold together, or that they had trouble knowing where the starting point was. The opportunity to emphasize the fantastic inability that we as human beings have in trying to imitate nature was clearly shown in the students’ responses. Humans are obviously not birds and although we may be able to <span class="show_mobile">observe the necessary steps taken to construct a nest we still may not understand their underlying decision making process. In closing the lesson I wanted to try and get this across to the students that our inability to replicate these pieces of avian architecture gives us that much more of a responsibility to protect the environment in which they are created. In this workshop the students were able to see the effects of waste on the environment through the materials that they had personally gathered. They came away from the workshop with their own interpretation of a bird’s nest. Also, the students hopefully went home with greater appreciation for the environment and their ability to make positive change for the protection of the wonderful structures that nature displays.</span>

                <p class="bold fourtwenty">How can this be used in other facets of teaching?</p>
                <p>Developing a learning experience that involves being able to have hands on interaction with the materials used in nature is vital to a more practical <span class="show_mobile">understanding of structures found in nature. The ability to not only observe what is in nature from afar, but to put the student in a position to have a tactile relationship with the materials that are used encourages a broader understanding of the subject. The subject matter of the workshop is not solely limited to the construction of a nest, but can be used to study many other types of structures made in the animal kingdom, such as beehives, coral, beaver dams, etc. Encouraging learning through making should be a necessary component to any teaching structure and this nest-building workshop is but one way to get students out into the field to experience the wonders of our natural world.</span>

                <p class="fourtwenty">This fall, the seventh annual A Better World by Design Conference featured two STEAM-led workshops led by leaders from the Brown and RISD teams. Show me the Way, an interactive and unconventional mapmaking exercise, allowed students to roam the College Hill campuses and assemble information to aid in constructing maps of any form besides planar. The STEAM team chose the topic of creating and designing maps because cartography is a classic example of a field which must simultaneously satisfy technical and human needs. A map needs to be accurate, but it also needs to be easy to understand; so it’s the type of problem that needs to be tackled in a multidisciplinary manner. </p>

                <p class="fourten">With the advancement of three- dimensional (3D) modeling and printing technologies, it has become much easier to create personal objects on demand. 3D printed models can turn imagination into reality, and create realistic replicas of objects in stunning detail. With 3D printing, that rare and beautiful thing you saw on a museum shelf could decorate your desk the next day - all you need is a computer and a little bit of technical support. In this workshop, we taught participants the technical details of 3D modeling, 3D printing technologies, and how to utilize them to make a replica of an object. </p>

                <p>To do so, we designed a two-part workshop using available resources from RISD and Brown University.</p>
                <p class="bold">Part I. Generating the computer models</p>
                <p>Participants picked an object from the RISD Nature Lab archive and learned how to convert that object into a computer aided design (CAD) with the help of open source Autodesk programs. At the end of the workshop, each participant had a realistic visualization of their design.</p>
                <p class="bold">Part II. 3D printing the computer models</p>
                <p>Participants learned how to convert their CAD into the format suitable for 3D printing. Using the Brown University Prince Lab 3D printer, they printed a personal replica of the object picked in part I of the workshop.</p>

                <p class="bold">Importance for STEAM learning</p>
                <p>Learning from non-text sources is becoming more popular across disciplines. To enhance the learning experience, institutions have explored different visual tools such as photography, drawing, digital imagery, and videography. However these tools ignore one of our strongest senses: touch. Just imagine how much more we could learn about form, texture and details by touching. To be able to do that, we need to bring our teaching materials from a 2D to a 3D world. This is where 3D printing comes into play. With the advancement of this technology, now it is much easier to make realistic replicas of rare natural objects and use them as teaching materials.</p>
                <p>In this workshop, we taught participants how to convert a nature object to a 3D printed replica.</p>

                <p>A veterinarian friend once told me that in order to avoid depression in the lions at the zoo, the caretakers would feed them their portion of meat inside a big block of ice. The process of trying to get to the meat served as a stimulating challenge. I cannot know for sure how the lion feels when facing his block, but I surely connected to this story in a very personal way. For me, knowledge can be that piece of meat. When engaged (obsessed) with a question, the answer can feel as if locked in a block of ice. Not entirely accessible, but still close enough for me to get a glimpse through the solid translucency, I know it is in there somewhere; I can smell it, and therefore will not “drop it.”

                <p>As you might imagine, the lion will not limit its struggle for access to only one side of the block. Neither will I. I am interested in the art making process that serves as a probe: a means for investigation. I enjoy approaching a question through different angles and perspectives.</p>
                <p>In 2010 I started a participatory project where by lending plants our mobility, they could walk down the streets as a moving forest claiming for its place and respect in a city that is also theirs. This is an ongoing project in which my interest has recently expanded from plants that borrow my human mobility to include myself trying out their stillness as well.</p>
                <p>I spent a big part of my summer standing in the forest, surrounded by trees and counting how long I could remain still with them. I recorded my experiences through writing, field recordings, drawings and photographic documentation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right chunk">
                <p> I also started writing scores for movement that would allow me to reenact some of the “meeting” experiences I had had in the woods with trees, plants and even specific parts of them such as leaves or roots.</p>
                <p>Still standing, I became obsessed with the idea of the first step. If you have been immobile for a long, long, long time and then you are granted movement: what do you do with it? After that amount of time can you imagine what a first step feels like? It immediately becomes an aware one, I think. It gains weight and significance; I imagine you appreciate it and use it wisely. From my perspective, this idea seems relevant to ecological thinking, as it establishes a parallel with the relationship between our intentions and our footprint (the impact of our acts).</p>
                <p>Afterwards, I started wondering about the sound of that first step pulling itself out of the ground and <span class="show_mobile">fantasized with the projection of this small gesture resonating like thunder in space.</span>

                <p>I strapped contact microphones around my foot, buried it under the ground and then waited. Once again I stood still for a long, long, long time and then slowly started to pull my wired foot out of the ground. This specific type of microphone allowed me to pick up not sound waves travelling through the air but vibrating through the contact points between my foot and the ground. This difference is as important to me as performing the stillness that preludes this conceptual and physical step. The sound collected is sourced from a real experience and captured from that vibrating space of contact. </p>
                <p>Trying to nibble around the corners of my ice block once more, I decided to translate this sound of a first step into movement again. So, I used transducer speakers to allow the sound collected to vibrate through bone-like sculptures and pronounce itself with movement.</p>

                <p> My inert-looking sculptures became the vibrating speakers that reproduced this minimal stage of movement, a step.</p>

                <p>My “meat” is not really a matter of mobility or immobility, especially now that I understand that the latter cannot exist. What drives me is the attempt of gaining insight into those moments when movement happens in scales and speeds that I (we?) cant normally perceive. I also think that it is the focus with which one maintains a question or <span class="show_mobile">topic for a sustained, hungry amount of time that causes the divides to blur. My process of repeatedly searching - research - to explore this question made me care not about mediums and/ or disciplines, but to stay focused on trying to break my block.</span>

                <p>Regardless of the amount of translations into drawings, writing, performances, videos, sound, sculpture and experience that I have been engaged with, this is probably only a first step and the reason why I am still hungry. </p>
                <p>Hopefully in the long run, the connection between these apparently disparate points will create a clearer picture of how I may come to understand other forms of not only movement but ultimately other forms of living beings, such as plants.</p>

                <p> This project aims to analyze how design functions to create meaningful visions of the future. It seeks to investigate why the material world is the way it is, what is required for it to be different, and how individuals can aspire to generate discourse about change. These are the questions of both scientists and designers, of anthropologists and ethnographers, and of children and students. In contemporary society, individuals from all disciplines play key roles in determining how our world is shaped. </p>

                <p>From the products in stores to the information in textbooks, an individual’s choice of what to buy or learn or do impacts the world they perceive and occupy. Still, the world exists in the context of its past, and human choices in the present can only be made with a consideration of one’s knowledge, one’s personal history, and one’s imaginings (See Fig. 1); in effect, decisions in the present can be made with respect to a past– or a future–orientation.
                </p>
                <p class="fourten">Because science and design are often concerned with improving human society and bettering the built environment, I’m interested in evaluating how considerations of the future affect human decision making. Ultimately, I’m interested in learning how designers can use complex future-oriented decision making to effect positive change and forecast the future; I’m also interested in learning how science contributes to the realism of imagined future worlds. To do this, I’m conducting research about how the human mind processes future-oriented thinking.

Individuals constantly generate mental versions of themselves; whether it’s planning what to wear in the morning, thinking about what to do each day, or ruminating on what kind of person one would like to be ten years from now, generating future selves is inextricably linked to human consciousness (Oyserman &amp; James 2009). </p>

                <p class="fourfive">From a psychological perspective, future selves can be sorted and classified by their valence [relative positivity or negativity], their likelihood [their probability of occurring], and their proximity [how close they are to the present or how far they are into the future] (Oyserman &amp; James 2009). Realizing successive positive future selves results in positive individual evolutions that lead to more significant life changes—like how hopping between imagined stepping stones allows one to cross a metaphorical stream (See Fig. 4). The mental stepping stones and imagined future selves are significant because a clear path invites one to consider overcoming an obstacle far more strongly then if no path were discernible at all. Applying this information, designers can posit proximal future-oriented ideas or make physical imagined constructions in order to allow mental tourists to accompany them on journeys into the future (See Fig. 5).</p>

                <p>Designers build paths into the future from a personal store of information and sensory experience reengineered through imagination. The designer’s ability to generate ideas that challenge the tradition of the present stems from their power to free themselves from fear of judgement and from established, isolated thoughts. It is my belief that interdisciplinary education is a prerequisite to idea synthesis; for this reason, while working on this project and gaining a firmer grasp on ideas about the misty future, I’ve read speculative fiction, the work of other interdisciplinary designers, and scientific literature about everything from psychology to geology. While reading, I try to isolate the general ideas—the kinds of ideas that may originate in a specific study but that can apply more widely to other academic fields. As a biology student, I do a fair amount of thinking about the intersection of design and living systems, deemed ecosystem literacy in Figure 9.

                <p>In Richard Dawkins’ renowned 1976 book, The Selfish Gene, the author outlines how genes, which lead directly to traits, have an informational analogue; Dawkins argues that memes, or small bits of information, can be passed culturally from generation to generation in an evolutionary process that mimics DNA transmission (Dawkins 1989). This idea, while only tenuously related to considerations about the future, aids one considerably in contextualizing the role of interdisciplinary thinking in generating new ideas. Scientists, synthetic biologists, and bioengineers—individuals who take an engineering approach to biology— isolate DNA in the form of genes and sequence, recombine, mutate, engineer, and transform them into new hosts in order to produce original transgenic organisms. This process, in turn, can be applied to memes—in essence, cultural ideas regardless of field can be found, evaluated, combined, edited, spliced together, and transformed into individuals in a speculative process that<span class="show_mobile"> parallels the work of the synthetic biologist and that eventually results in the generation of new, interdisciplinary thoughts. By reading broadly with an open mind, individuals can be exposed to novel methods of thinking that can inform their work, make them think differently, and allow them to come up with original ideas.</span>

                <p class="fourten">Having freed oneself from established modes of thinking, imagination functions as an engine for synthesis. Imagination brings us back to projection and projection relates directly to thinking about the future—for constructing new parallel realities from everyday experience and the information gained from interdisciplinary education (See again Fig. 1, Fig. 8). In this context, speculative designs build fictional worlds from constructed memories (See Fig. 6). </p>
                <p class="fourtwenty">Playing off of trends in the past, art and design influence contemporary society. By leading individuals into favorable fictional futures through building tangible waypoints, designers can thus guide the probable into the preferable and shape the desirable by altering the considerations made by those individuals, brands, and governments who define policy. In this way, designers can upend convention and inspire thought about different realities. </p>

                <p> This past summer, we spent three weeks in Southern California investigating the history of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) and affiliated historic sites. SSFL is a former rocket test facility responsible in part for the engines that powered the Apollo missions. The site is also home to the Burro Flats painted cave, sacred to the Chumash tribe, and believed by some to be connected with astronomical observation. </p>
                <p>Our research started at a military base in the central valley, where many of the rocket engines developed at SSFL were launched.</p>

                <p class="fourten">We spent several hours with a military historian and trumpet player who toured us around various launch sites and Honda Ridge (a Chumash pictograph). Our journey then took us to the Mojave Desert, where we met with a NASA historian and toured the Deep Space Network further informing our understanding of this constellation of interconnected military sites within the Southern California landscape. On our return we met with the head of the Griffith Observatory, an expert in archeo-astronomy. He described his affiliation with Burro Flats and his experiences observing significant astronomical events. We also engaged with an archeologist who specialized in Chumash sites, he enlightened us to the religious significance of the cave and other surrounding locations. Our tour ended with a visit to SSFL that was sponsored by NASA and Boeing, two of the current owners of the facility. During our time at SSFL, we visited various rocket test stands, observation stations, and the ruins of a ranch that existed prior to the laboratory. </p>

                <p>Throughout our visit in California, we also engaged with members of the community who have been directly affected by the site, and listened to their personal narratives.</p>
                <p>Through these meetings, we were able to draw on a wealth of content, in totality generating a rich picture of the site from a wide breadth of experience, from the personal to the professional, the scientific to the historical and the anthropological to archeological. Our expectations were exceeded by the richness and complexity of the site’s history that continues to unfold and transition from a religious site, to a ranch, to a Hollywood filming location, to a research facility and on into whatever will come next. The entire history of California can be encapsulated in this small parcel of land, thus signifying the complexity of the Western landscape.</p>

                <p>This experience is feeding into our own artistic practices, informing our research process and multi-disciplinary approach to art-making. Throughout our experience we interacted with people from many different fields, with little to no connection to the art world. Through these interactions we learned how to articulate our ideas for a wider audience and developed our own visual language that borrows from these fields of expertise. For example, Aly is working on a project that uses the language of military documentation in the exploration and reconstruction of a historical event. Vivian, in turn, is using Cold War imagery (vintage video and audio and found objects) to speak about the sublime nature of violent technologies.</p>
                <p>We learned that while it was important to plan out and research in advance, some of the most interesting experiences happened through connections we formed along the way. </p>

                <p>This context for creating original art is freeing and constrictive at the same time; groups with different backgrounds gives individuals a chance to quickly step out of their comfort zone, with little consequence if the end result isn’t as expected; after all, it is only a weekend spent, and even the art is only on display for around three hours total. Because of this, people tend to take on riskier ideas, or projects they wouldn’t normally consider. The quick deadline also forces people to learn and adapt quickly; projects began with an idea, and if you don’t know the technology or don’t have the skills to make it happen, you either figure it out (usually with the help of others), or improvise.</p>

                <p class="fourfive">There was no real structure until we started converting the space to gallery mode Saturday afternoon, which helped people feel comfortable working at their own pace. Discussion and preparation continued into the night. Some groups, like Faith Holland and Nadav Assor, hammered out their ideas rather quickly- in their case, an installation taking advantage of pavlovian responses to notification sounds. Other groups, like Kye Franz, Allison Burtch, and Mimi Campbell, formed by mutual interest, without a clear destination.
                </p>
                <p>Friday was when most of the work began in earnest. The environment of the space became a productive mixture of hard work and relaxed discussion. Having everyone working in the same space proved invaluable; being surrounded by other people working on their projects made working on your own easier, and help was easy to come by if anyone was stuck on a problem. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="right chunk">
                <p>Being able to see all the work take shape and talk to the people making it was also one of the most valuable things about the environment, as everyone ended up having some kind of investment or learning about a project other than their own. Projects with physical components started to come into being- David Braun started to install and calibrate his projection-mapping Panopticomical, and the professor/ student group of Carl Lostritto, Shou Jie Eng, Linyi Dai and Chen Shun began the cyclical printing process of their self-referential pen plotter process.</p>
                <p class="fourfive">On Saturday, final pieces came together and the gallery started to become frenzy with the installation of the work. Though slightly panicked, the final hours didn’t carry a huge burden of stress- with the final output of the work being an extremely temporary exhibit, there wasn’t winning or losing, just a celebration of the work people had done.</p>

                <p> Interactive Fruits was a workshop, facilitated by Ria Mirchandani (a student at Brown University), which paired RISD and Brown students alike to experiment with Scratch, the world’s simplest programming language.</p>
                <p>Scratch is developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten research lab at the MIT Media Lab, where Ria does research. Ria’s interest was in getting adult audiences to try out Scratch, which is most often used by children ages 5-10. Her hypothesis was that the creative minds of RISD and Brown students together would be able to draw equally interesting conclusions about how to use the language.</p>

                <p>A group of 14 or so students collected and used Makey Makey kits to create interactive applications which had elements of animations, musical instruments, and toys. One group created a musical instrument that played a sound whenever a fruit was passed to a different person. Another group made a word-keyboard of sorts controlled by fruit. Indeed, Ria’s hypothesis that an easily accessible framework such as Scratch would serve as a great catalyst for creation, was proven true. Interactive Fruits also showed that although Scratch was designed for children, adults could also engage with it easily. Lastly, the experience showed us that the use of a simple intermediary language (which is not of the discipline of either participant) could engender great collaboration.</p>

                <p> In the fall of 2014, RISD, Brown, and MIT STEAM welcomed a new university to our network of student organizations. Yale is now officially a hub for interdisciplinary work, play, learning, and creating in Connecticut!</p>
                <p class="fourfifteen"> As our network continues to grow, we will find more successful interactions across disciplines, and publish even larger catalogues!

                <p>We strongly recommend that you locate two faculty or administrative advisers for your organization. This could be a Dean, Professor, or anyone else who is knowledgeable about the way your school works. We also recommend that you find 2-3 other passionate students that you want to work with in leading STEAM at your organization.</p>
                <p>Lastly, find an initial membership of at least ten people that are interested in STEAM events (probably your friends).</p>
